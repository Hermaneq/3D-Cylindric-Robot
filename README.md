# Cylindrical Robot Model

This project presents a 3D model of a cylindrical robot created using Blender and subsequently integrated into a Python program with the assistance of Panda3D. The program facilitates control over the robot's arm, manipulation using a gripper, object transportation, dropping objects, recording robot movements, and playing them back. Additionally, it enables controlling the robot by inputting x, y, z coordinates for autonomous movement.
